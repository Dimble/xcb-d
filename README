XCB bindings for the D language.

Status: incomplete, pre-alpha

Currently this contains only two useful items:
xcb.d.        Manually translated from xcb.h from libxcb 1.8.1.
d_client.py.  This is based on c_client.py copied from libxcb 1.8.1.
              Note: files are written to xcb/foo.d

d_client.py is partly successful at converting the .xlm specifications in
xcb-proto into a form usable by D.  So far, many of the enums and former
#defines have an incorrect (or at least inconvenient) type.
Macros such as XCB_ATOM_WM_CLASS are defined as an enum, accessible as
XcbAtom.WM_CLASS.

Basically this is not yet usable unless your needs are minor.
However I am uploading this now in case I do not get around to finishing it.

xcbbuild.sh can be ignored.  It is an unfinished helper that someday might
prepare an import-ready xcb directory.

-----------------------

If you have still read this far and are determined to attempt to use this,
my dev process is as follows:

1.  get the xcb-proto sources (I used 1.7) and put it Somewhere
2.  xcbbuild.sh Somewhere/src/*.xml
    - In theory, this step prepares ./xcb with all the .d imports
3.  move/copy/link/teleport ./xcb to $d_include_stuff/std/c
4.  add import std.c.xcb.xcb; to the file and watch the errors scroll by

I probably forgot some steps and the ones I didn't may be wrong.
