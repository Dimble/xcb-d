D bindings for xcb
------------------

This is an attempt to generate xcb D bindings using xcbgen.
The aging project on dsource.org uses the previous xslt generator.

Library version:
xcb 1.8.1
xcb-proto 1.7.1
Other versions that use xcbgen might work.

Status:
Alpha, incomplete.
Headers can be generated from the xcb-proto sources and appear to import
successfully.  Only a few basic functions have been tested.

Contents:
xcb.d - manual translation of xcb.h from libxcb
d_client.py - conversion of c_client.py from libxcb
xcb - last attempted build of D bindings

d_client takes an argument of foo.xml and writes the header to xcb/foo.d.

Enum tag names are currently in CamelCase.  For example, XCB_ATOM_WM_CLASS
in xproto.h is XcbAtom.WM_CLASS in xproto.d.  Most enums and constants
currently have an incorrect (or at least inconvenient) base type.

xcbbuild.sh dreams of someday preparing the import xcb directory.
