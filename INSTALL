There is no install process.

I said, there is no install process.

There's really no.. ok, fine.


1.  Get the xcbgen module installed & accessible to python.
    It may be part of xcb-proto or in a separate python xcbgen package.

2.  get the xcb-proto sources in SomeLocation.

3.  ./xcbbuild.sh SomeLocation/src/*.xml
    - Ideally this will write the .d imports to ./xcb.

3b. xcbbuild.sh is just a dumb helper: d-client.py may be run on a file.

4.  Somehow install the now-filled ./xcb to D_INCLUDE_STUFF/std/c.

5.  Import std.c.xcb.XXX into your code and watch the errors scroll by.

6.  Fail to profit!
